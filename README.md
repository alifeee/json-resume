# CV

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.5. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

## Using in VSCode

Open `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\alifeee\cv` with Explorer and open VSCode via the context menu. WSL can be used via the console window. This way, [hot reload works](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/5155) in Bun.

Using it like this, sometimes VSCode's file explorer does not refresh properly.
